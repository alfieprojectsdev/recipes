### **Ingredients**

* **Chicken:** 500g–750g (cut into serving pieces; bone-in is better for the broth).
* **Chayote (Sayote):** 1-2 medium, peeled and wedged.
* **Ginger:** A thumb-sized piece, sliced or crushed (don't be shy with the ginger).
* **Onion:** 1 medium, chopped.
* **Garlic:** 3–4 cloves, minced.
* **Water:** 4–5 cups (or rice wash if you have it).
* **Patis (Fish Sauce):** 2 tablespoons (plus more to taste).
* **Cooking Oil:** 1 tablespoon.
* **Salt & Pepper:** To taste.

### **Instructions**

1. **Sauté the Aromatics:** Heat oil in a pot. Sauté the ginger first until it smells fragrant and the edges slightly brown. Add the onions and garlic, cooking until softened.
2. **Sear the Chicken:** Add the chicken pieces. Cook for about 3–5 minutes until the outer part of the chicken turns light brown.
3. **Season:** Pour in the **patis** (fish sauce) and let it "cook" with the chicken for a minute—this gets rid of the raw fishy smell and deepens the flavor.
4. **Simmer:** Add the water (or rice wash). Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Cover and let it cook for about 20 minutes (or until the chicken is tender).
* *Tip: Skim off any scum that rises to the top for a clearer broth.*


5. **Add Chayote:** Drop in the chayote wedges. Simmer for another 5–8 minutes until the chayote is fork-tender but not mushy.
6. **Final Touch:** Taste the broth. Adjust with more patis or a pinch of salt and pepper if needed.

Serve it hot with a bowl of steamed white rice.
