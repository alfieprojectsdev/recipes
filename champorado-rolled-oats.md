### Rolled Oats Champorado (Serves 5)

**Ingredients**

- **Rolled Oats:** 2 ½ cups
- **Water:** 7 to 8 cups (Rolled oats need more liquid than quick oats)
- **Tablea:** 6 to 8 discs (pure cacao)
- **Sugar:** ½ to ¾ cup (Brown or Muscovado preferred; adjust if using sweetened milk later)
- **Salt:** 1 pinch (literally just a dusting, given your salt sensitivity)

**Instructions**

1. **Dissolve Chocolate:** Bring **7 cups** of water to a boil in a large pot. Add tablea. Stir/whisk until fully dissolved and water is dark.
2. **Add Oats:** Stir in the rolled oats and the pinch of salt.
3. **Simmer:** Lower heat to medium-low. Simmer for **10–12 minutes**, stirring frequently to prevent sticking.
4. **Adjust Consistency:**
	- *Too thick?* Add the remaining 1 cup of water.
	- *Too thin?* Cook for 2–3 more minutes (it will thicken as it cools).
5. **Sweeten:** Stir in sugar now, or leave bland and sweeten individually at the table.
6. **Serve:** Ladle into bowls and top with evaporated or condensed milk.

**Texture Check:** Rolled oats retain a "chewy" texture unlike the mush of quick oats. Done when oats are soft but distinct.
