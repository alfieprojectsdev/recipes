# Family Recipes (Scaled for 5)

## **IP Chicken & Wombok Braise (Scaled for 5)**

**Prep time:** 10 mins | **IP Time:** ~25 mins (including preheat and release)

#### **The Ingredients**

* **Chicken:** **1kg Chicken Quarters**. For five people, it’s best to **halve these** (separating the drumstick from the thigh) so everyone gets a piece and they fit better in the pot.
* **Wombok:** The **entire head** of old cabbage, cut into 2-inch wide ribbons.
* **Ginger:** A **3-inch thumb**, sliced into thick coins (more ginger helps **Bhazel’s** cold).
* **Garlic:** **5–6 cloves**, smashed.
* **Chicken Powder:** **3 tablespoons** (Fill your **1/4 cup measure  full**).
* **Water:** **Only 1 cup**. Old wombok is full of water that will release under pressure, creating its own broth.
* **Pepper:** **1/2 teaspoon** of black pepper for warmth.

### **Instant Pot Instructions**

1. **Sauté (Aromatics):** Set IP to **Sauté**. Add a splash of oil and fry the **ginger and garlic** until the kitchen smells like ginger—this "therapeutic" aroma is great for **Bhazel**.
2. **The Chicken:** Add the **1kg of chicken pieces** skin-side down. Let them sear for 3 minutes to render the yellow fat; this fat is where the best flavor for the "braise" comes from.
3. **Deglaze:** Pour in the **1 cup of water** and scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to ensure no bits are stuck (prevents the "Burn" notice).
4. **Season:** Stir in your **3/4-full 1/4 cup** of chicken powder and the pepper.
5. **Pressure Cook:** Seal the lid. Set to **High Pressure for 10 minutes**.
6. **Natural Release:** Let the pressure drop on its own for **10 minutes**. This keeps the chicken juicy and "fall-off-the-bone" tender for **Andrej and Arja**.

### **The "Space-Clearing" Finish**

1. **Open the Lid:** The chicken will be swimming in a shallow, golden broth.
2. **Add the Wombok:** Pile the **entire mountain of old cabbage** on top of the chicken. It might look like too much, but it will shrink significantly.
3. **Sauté Mode:** Set the IP back to **Sauté**. Use your tongs to gently fold the cabbage into the hot liquid.
4. **Wilt:** Simmer for **3–5 minutes**. The cabbage will soften into a buttery texture, and that "old cabbage" taste will transform into a sweet, savory glaze.

## **Savory Ginger-Soy Bangus & Chayote**

**Servings:** 5 people | **Prep time:** 10 mins | **Cook time:** 15 mins

#### **The Ingredients**

* **Fish:** Your thawed **marinated boneless bangus**.
* **Veggie:** **1 large Chayote**, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch thick "tongues" (long slices).
* **Aromatics:** **5 cloves garlic** (minced) and a **2-inch thumb of ginger** (sliced into thin matchsticks).
* **The Sauce:** * **2 tbsp Soy Sauce**
* **1 tsp Sugar** (to balance the vinegar from the fish marinade).
* **1/2 cup Water**
* **1/4 tsp Black Pepper**.

### **Preparation Instructions**

1. **Pan-Fry the Fish:** Heat a large skillet with a bit of oil. Fry the **bangus** skin-side down first until crispy, then flip. Since it’s boneless and marinated, it will cook fast—about 3 minutes per side. Remove the fish and set aside.
2. **Sauté the Aromatics:** In the same pan (keep those tasty fish bits!), sauté the **garlic and ginger** matchsticks. The ginger is key for **Bhazel's** congestion.
3. **Simmer the Chayote:** Add the **chayote** slices to the pan. Toss them in the oil for a minute, then pour in the soy sauce, water, and sugar.
4. **The Soften:** Cover the pan and simmer for **5–7 minutes**. Chayote is "new" and firm, so it needs this bit of liquid to become tender for **Andrej and Arja**.
5. **The Reunion:** Once the chayote is fork-tender, slide the fried bangus back into the pan. Spoon the sauce over the fish and simmer for **1 final minute** so the flavors meld.
