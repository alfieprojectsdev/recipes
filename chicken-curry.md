### **Pinoy Chicken Curry**

*Yield: 5-6 Servings | Prep time: 15 mins | Cook time: 30 mins*

## ingredients

* 1 kg Chicken (thighs or drumsticks preferred)
* 2 cups Coconut milk (Gata)
* 3 tbsp Curry powder
* 2 large Potatoes & 1 large Carrot (cubed)
* 1 Red bell pepper (sliced)
* 2-inch Ginger (julienned), 1 Onion, 4 cloves Garlic
* 2 tbsp Fish sauce (patis)
* 1 small piece Siling labuyo (optional, for heat)

## instructions

1. **Sear:** On induction (**Medium-High / 1800W**), fry potatoes and carrots until edges are lightly browned; set aside.
2. **Saute:** In the same pan, saute ginger, garlic, and onion. Add the chicken and cook until the outer layer is no longer pink.
3. **Season:** Stir in the curry powder and fish sauce. Ensure the chicken is well-coated.
4. **Simmer:** Pour in the coconut milk. Drop heat to **Low-Medium (600W-800W)**. Simmer for 15–20 minutes until the chicken is tender.
5. **Finish:** Add back the potatoes, carrots, and bell peppers. Simmer for another 5 minutes until the sauce thickens and veggies are soft.

## additional notes / alternative ingredients

* **Alt:** For a thicker sauce, you can mash one of the cooked potato cubes into the curry.
* **Sub:** If using canned coconut cream (unang piga), add a little water during the initial simmer and save the thickest cream for the last 5 minutes.
