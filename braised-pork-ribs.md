### **Ingredients**

- **Meat:** 1 kg pork ribs (cut into individual bones or 2-inch pieces).
- **Aromatics:** 4 cloves garlic (smashed), 1 medium onion (quartered), 2-3 slices ginger.
- **Braising Liquid:** \* 1/2 cup soy sauce
	- 1/4 cup vinegar (cane or coconut)
	- 3 tbsp brown sugar
	- 2 cups water (or enough to just cover the ribs)
	- 2 pieces star anise (optional)
	- 2 pieces dried bay leaves
- **Seasoning:** 1 tsp whole black peppercorns, salt to taste.
- **Thickener (Optional):** 1 tbsp cornstarch dissolved in 2 tbsp water.

### **Instructions**

1. **Sear:** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large pot or heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the pork ribs on all sides. Remove excess rendered fat if desired.
2. **Sauté:** Add garlic, onion, and ginger to the pot with the ribs. Sauté for 2 minutes until fragrant.
3. **Combine:** Pour in soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, water, peppercorns, star anise, and bay leaves. **Do not stir** immediately to let the vinegar cook off for 1-2 minutes.
4. **Simmer:** Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer. Cover the pot.
5. **Tenderize:** Cook for 1.5 to 2 hours (or 30–40 minutes in a pressure cooker) until the meat is fork-tender and pulling away from the bone.
6. **Reduce:** Remove the lid. Increase heat to medium-high for 10 minutes to reduce the sauce until it reaches a syrupy consistency.
7. **Finish:** If a thicker glaze is desired, stir in the cornstarch slurry and simmer for 1 minute. Season with salt if needed.

### **Efficiency Notes**

- **Texture:** For "fall-off-the-bone" ribs, ensure the simmer is low and slow; boiling too hard can toughen the meat fibers.
- **Advance Prep:** This dish tastes better the next day as the flavors penetrate the bone; can be stored in the fridge and reheated easily.
