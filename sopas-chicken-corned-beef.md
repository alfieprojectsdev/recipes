### **Sopas (Corned Beef or Chicken)**

*Yield: 5 Servings | Prep time: 10 mins | Cook time: 25 mins*

---

### **Ingredients**

- **Aromatics:** 2 tbsp butter/oil, 1 medium onion (diced), 3 cloves garlic (minced).
- **Protein (Choose one):** \* 1 can (150g-200g) Corned Beef
	- 250g Chicken (boiled and shredded)
- **Vegetables:** 1 large carrot (diced), 1 bunch pechay (stalks diced, leaves shredded).
- **Pasta:** 200g macaroni (elbow).
- **Liquid:** 6-8 cups water + 1 chicken bouillon cube (or chicken broth), 1 can (370ml) evaporated milk.
- **Seasoning:** Fish sauce (*patis*), salt, and black pepper.

---

### **Instructions**

1. **Sauté:** Heat butter/oil in a large pot. Sauté onion and garlic until fragrant.
2. **Sear Protein:** \* *If using Corned Beef:* Add to pot and sauté for 2 minutes until slightly browned.
	- *If using Chicken:* Add shredded chicken and sauté for 3 minutes.
3. **Boil:** Pour in water/broth and add the bouillon cube. Bring to a boil.
4. **Cook Pasta & Stalks:** Add macaroni, carrots, and pechay stalks. Simmer for 8–10 minutes or until pasta is *al dente*.
5. **Cream:** Lower heat. Pour in evaporated milk and stir.
6. **Wilt Greens:** Add pechay leaves. Stir for 1 minute until wilted.
7. **Season:** Season with *patis*, salt, and plenty of black pepper.

> **Note:** If the soup is too thin, mash 5–10 pieces of cooked macaroni into a paste and stir back in to thicken.

### **Cost/Efficiency Notes**

- **Pechay:** Using both stalks (for crunch) and leaves (for bulk) eliminates the need for celery or cabbage.
- **Corned Beef:** Provides built-in salt and fat, requiring less manual seasoning than chicken.

Would you like me to adjust the measurements for a specific pot size or provide a quick "order of operations" for the Bibimbap prep while this simmers?
