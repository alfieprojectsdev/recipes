# 🍲 Family Recipes

A centralized, version-controlled collection of recipes optimized for fast recall and offline use. These notes are stripped of narrative fluff to ensure clarity when things are moving fast in the kitchen.

## 📋 Repository Purpose
- **Distraction-Free:** No blogs, no ads, no "story behind the dish." Just ingredients and instructions.
- **Local-First:** Designed to be accessed via terminal, markdown viewer, or local LLM (e.g., Daemon).
- **Version Control:** Tracking tweaks to cook times and ingredients over the years.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Scaling & Portions
All recipes in this repository are **scaled for a family of 5** (2 adults, 3 children). 
- Protein targets are generally **750g - 1kg** per meal.
- Rice portions are scaled for high-volume consumption.
