# 🍲 Family Recipes

A centralized, version-controlled collection of recipes optimized for fast recall and offline use. These notes are stripped of narrative fluff to ensure clarity when things are moving fast in the kitchen.

## 📋 Repository Purpose
- **Distraction-Free:** No blogs, no ads, no "story behind the dish." Just ingredients and instructions.
- **Local-First:** Designed to be accessed via terminal, markdown viewer, or local LLM (e.g., Daemon).
- **Version Control:** Tracking tweaks to cook times and ingredients over the years.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Scaling & Portions
All recipes in this repository are **scaled for a family of 5** (2 adults, 3 children). 
- Protein targets are generally **750g - 1kg** per meal.
- Rice portions are scaled for high-volume consumption.

## 📂 Structure
- `/filipino`: Traditional household staples (Adobo, Nilaga, etc.).
- `/korean`: Bibimbap and other regional favorites.
- `/instant-pot`: Optimized pressure cooker recipes for efficiency.
- `/drafts`: Experimental recipes or those currently being refined.

## 🛠 Usage Tips
- **Search:** Use `grep` or `ripgrep` to find recipes by ingredient.
  ```bash
  grep -r "Pork Kasim" .

## ⚡ Hardware Settings
- **Induction:** Most stir-fry and searing should happen at medium-high (1600W-2000W / 180°C-200°C). For simmering (Adobo/Bistek), drop to 400W-600W.
- **Instant Pot:** Always ensure the sealing ring is seated. Use "Natural Release" for meats to keep them tender; "Quick Release" for veggies to avoid mushiness.
- **Air-Dry Rule:** For the Max's Style Chicken, use your induction stove's high-heat stability for the flash-fry, but ensure the chicken is bone-dry first to avoid oil splatter.
