- **Local-First:** Designed to be accessed via terminal, markdown viewer, or local LLM (e.g., Daemon).
- **Version Control:** Tracking tweaks to cook times and ingredients over the years.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Scaling & Portions
All recipes in this repository are **scaled for a family of 5** (2 adults, 3 children). 
- Protein targets are generally **750g - 1kg** per meal.

## 🛠 Usage Tips
- **Search:** Use the included lookup script to find recipes by ingredient or name:
  ```bash
  ./lookup.sh "pork kasim"
  ```

## ⚡ Hardware Settings
- **Induction:** Most stir-fry and searing should happen at medium-high (1600W-2000W / 180°C-200°C). For simmering (Adobo/Bistek), drop to 400W-600W.
- **Instant Pot:** Always ensure the sealing ring is seated. Use "Natural Release" for meats to keep them tender; "Quick Release" for veggies to avoid mushiness.
- **Air-Dry Rule:** For the Max's Style Chicken, use your induction stove's high-heat stability for the flash-fry, but ensure the chicken is bone-dry first to avoid oil splatter.
