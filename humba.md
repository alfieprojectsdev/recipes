### Humba for 5 (Visayan Style)

**Ingredients**

- **Meat:** 1.2 to 1.5 kg Pork Pata (front or hind leg), cut into 1.5-inch slices
- **Liquid Base:**
	- ½ cup Soy Sauce
	- ½ cup Vinegar (Cane or Coconut)
	- 1 cup Pineapple Juice (or water)
- **Sweetener:** ¾ cup Brown Sugar (Muscovado is best)
- **Aromatics:**
	- 1 head Garlic (crushed or minced)
	- 1 medium Onion (chopped)
	- 3 pcs Bay Leaves (Laurel)
	- 1 tsp Whole Black Peppercorns
- **Add-ins:**
	- 2 tbsp Salted Black Beans (*Tausi*), rinsed well to remove excess salt
	- 1 cup Dried Banana Blossoms (*Bulaklak ng Saging*), soaked in warm water and knotted

**Instructions**

1. **Combine & Boil:** Place pork, soy sauce, vinegar, pineapple juice, garlic, onion, peppercorns, and bay leaves in a pot. Bring to a boil. **Do not stir** for the first 3 minutes to cook off the raw vinegar taste.
2. **Tenderize:**
	- *Stovetop:* Cover and simmer on low for 1.5 to 2 hours.
	- *Pressure Cooker:* Cook on High for 20–25 minutes.
3. **Add Extras:** Once meat is tender, add the brown sugar, rinsed tausi, and soaked banana blossoms. Stir gently.
4. **Reduce (Crucial Step):** Remove the lid. Simmer on medium-high heat (approx 90°C–100°C) for 15–20 minutes.
5. **Finish:** Cook until the sauce thickens into a syrupy glaze and the natural oil from the pork separates/floats on top.
6. **Serve:** Best served with hot rice to balance the rich sauce.
