### **Egg Drop Soup (with Corn & Crab Sticks)**

*Yield: 5-6 Servings | Prep time: 10 mins | Cook time: 10 mins*

---

## ingredients

* 2 cans (425g each) Cream-style corn
* 6-8 pieces Crab sticks (shredded or sliced)
* 3 large Eggs (beaten)
* 4 cups Chicken broth (or 4 cups water + 2 bouillon cubes)
* 2 tbsp Cornstarch (diluted in 1/4 cup cold water)
* Salt, white pepper, and a dash of sesame oil
* Spring onions (chopped) for garnish

## instructions

1. Bring chicken broth and cream-style corn to a boil on your induction stove (**High / 2000W**).
2. Once boiling, drop heat to medium (**800W-1000W**) and add the crab sticks. Simmer for 3 minutes.
3. Pour in the cornstarch slurry while stirring constantly until the soup thickens.
4. **The Ribbon Technique:** Turn the heat to low. Pour the beaten eggs in a very thin, slow stream while stirring the soup gently in one direction to create long "ribbons."
5. Turn off heat. Season with salt, white pepper, and sesame oil. Top with spring onions.

## additional notes / alternative ingredients

* **Alt:** Add minced carrots or peas for more color/texture.
* **Tip:** If the soup is too thick, add a splash of water; if too thin, add more cornstarch slurry.
