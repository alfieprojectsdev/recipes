### **Max's Style Fried Chicken**
*Yield: 5 Servings | Prep time: 60 mins | Cook time: 60 mins*

---

## ingredients
* 1.5 kg Chicken (roughly 1.5 whole chickens or 8-10 leg quarters)
* Calamansi juice (1/3 cup)
* 3 tbsp Fish sauce (patis)
* 1.5 tsp Black pepper
* Oil for deep frying

## instructions
1. Marinate chicken in calamansi, patis, and pepper for at least 1 hour.
2. Steam the chicken for 30–45 minutes until fully cooked.
3. Remove from steamer and let it air-dry completely (surface must be bone-dry for the "crackle").
4. Flash-fry in very hot oil (180°C) until skin is golden brown and crisp.

## additional notes / alternative ingredients
* **Note:** You will likely need to fry in batches to maintain oil temperature.
